 * In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, s, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

 - First, print each vowel in s  on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in .
 - Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in  s on a new line in the same order as it appeared in s.

 * Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function.
 * Print your output using 'console.log()'.
